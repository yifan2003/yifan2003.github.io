Beyond academia, I like sports and strategy games. I have a strong passion for soccer, having won a National Championship and earned an MVP award in university competitions. Other sports I enjoy include badminton, tennis, basketball, and kayaking.

In the realm of strategy games, Chinese Chess is a favorite. I have been honored with the title of Anhui Province Champion in this discipline.

During my second year at university, I embraced the role of president of the Programming Club. Together with my team, we organized contests and prepared diligently for ICPC/CCPC competitions. Our collective efforts elevated the club from a 2-star rating to an impressive 4-star.
