Welcome to my homepage! My name is Yifan Guo (郭一凡). I’m an incoming senior undergraduate at [the School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/). I'm in Interdisciplinary Talent Class (Math&Computer Science).

I am also a visiting student at the University of Chicago where I spent six fantastic months working with Professor Haifeng and Professor Ozan.

I have a broad interest in EconCS, especially its intersection with theoretical computer science and real-world impact.
