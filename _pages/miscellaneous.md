If I ever step away from academia, I could envision a career in soccer or Chinese Chess.

From my younger years, sports have been a significant part of my life, with soccer taking center stage. In fact, I secured a National Championship title early on. During my university years, our school team achieved both runner-up and third-place titles, marking the best performance in the school's history. Additionally, I was honored with the MVP award for my role as a midfielder and a captain. Beyond soccer, I have a fondness for badminton, tennis, basketball, and kayaking.

In the realm of strategic games, I'm drawn to Chinese Chess, poker, guandan, and eighty-points. I'm particularly proud of having earned the title of Anhui Province Champion in Chinese Chess.

During my second year at university, I embraced the role of president of the Programming Club. Together with my team, we organized contests and prepared diligently for ICPC/CCPC competitions. Our collective efforts elevated the club from a 2-star rating to an impressive 4-star.
