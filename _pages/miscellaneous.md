If I don't pursue an academic career, I might consider becoming a professional soccer player or even a professional Chinese Cheese player.

I have always had a passion for sports, with soccer being my favorite. I started playing soccer as a child and achieved great success, even winning the National Championship. As a midfielder, I take pleasure in creating opportunities and skillfully passing the ball to my teammates. 

Throughout my school years, I served as the captain of the School Team, where I earned numerous accolades such as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, a second-place finish (the greatest of all time), and a third-place finish.

Apart from soccer, I have a keen interest in card games like Chinese Cheese, Bridge, and Poker. I once secured the title of Anhui Province Champion in Chinese Cheese.

Furthermore, I had the privilege of being elected as the President of the Programming Club during my second year at college. With the invaluable assistance of my friend, we organized Programming Contests and diligently prepared for ICPC/CCPC competitions. Under my leadership, the club made remarkable progress, elevating its rating from a modest 2-star to an outstanding 4-starâ€”the highest rating ever achieved, solidifying our position as the second-best tier within the university.
