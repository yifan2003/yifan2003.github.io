Welcome to my homepage! My name is Yifan Guo (郭一凡). I’m an incoming senior undergraduate at [the School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/). I'm in Interdisciplinary Talent Class (Math\&Computer Science) and a visiting student at the University of Chicago where I spent six fantastic months working with Professor Haifeng and Professor Ozan.
